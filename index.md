- Optionally, a GitHub.com account. If you don't already have a GitHub.com account, you can [create one here](https://github.com/join). Take this short video [Getting Started with GitHub](https://youtu.be/noZnOSpcjYY) if you're brand new and want to get a high-level overview of the platform. This is only necessary if you'd like to use [Juncture](https://labs.jstor.org/projects/juncture/) and could come in handy for other purposes, too.

### IIIF for Art History

In addition to be a protocol/set of standards, IIIF is an open source community that is actively developing lots of free and cloud-based applications that can make using images interactive and deeply engaging. This guide will focus on a selection that are well developed but possibly not perfect (as of fall 2023), and that have applications especially for Art History:
- Juncture, from JSTOR Labs
- Mirador viewer
- [Exhibit](https://www.exhibit.so/)
