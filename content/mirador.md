# Mirador: What is it?

Mirador is a IIIF viewer that enables you to compare and annotate images from any digital collection that supports IIIF.

The "official" Mirador how-to site can be found here: [https://iiif.io/explainers/using_iiif_resources/#mirador](https://iiif.io/explainers/using_iiif_resources/#mirador)

To try Mirador viewer, you will need the address of a "Mirador viewer instance" - that means somewhere that someone is hosting the viewer itself. We have [a viewer](https://liblamp.uwm.edu/IIIF/mirador3.html) in the UWM Libraries that you can use. All you need to do is navigate to it and use it.  

- UWM Libraries Mirador viewer - [https://liblamp.uwm.edu/IIIF/mirador3.html](https://liblamp.uwm.edu/IIIF/mirador3.html)
- Next, you'll need to find the "manifest URL" for images you'd like to compare. In the UWM Digital Collections, the manifest URL is identified in the metadata record:
  
  <img src="/assets/images/iiif-manifest-uwm.png" width="200">

They usually look something like this:
- https://collections.lib.uwm.edu/iiif/info/celestial/16/manifest.json
But keep in mind that the manifest URL can vary by institution.
