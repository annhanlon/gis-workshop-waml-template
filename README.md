# IIIF Resources: Art History 

IIIF - or the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/) - is an open protocol to share digital objects and their metadata. It is especially well suited to high quality images, and designed to share cultural attributes like repository, artist/creator, date, medium, etc. This guide is designed to share information especially for UWM Art History faculty so that you can make the most of IIIF in your teaching and research.
